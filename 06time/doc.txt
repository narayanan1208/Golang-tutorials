Memory management

new() - Allocate memory but not initialized, you will get a memmory address, gives a zeroed storage(no data can be added).
make() - Allocated and initialized, same as new(), non-zeroed storages.

Garbage collection happens automatically
Anything that is out of scope or nil is eligible for GC
GOGC variable sets the initial GC target percentage.
default GOGC=100, setting GOGC=off disables GC entirely.
